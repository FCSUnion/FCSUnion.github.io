  <p>The Falkirk Cluster Students Union was formed in May 2023, inspired by the success of the <a href="https://ehssu.com">Edinburgh High School Students Union</a>, with the aim of giving a voice to young people in Falkirk. As High School students, it is often difficult to have our voices heard. However by joining together, we can collectively raise issues and create a better and more positive educational experience for all.

  A school students union is a group of pupils who join together to maintain and improve their school conditions, to make schools safer, more worthwhile, more enjoyable and to ensure we have all the resources we need.

  <br>             
  Unions are run by the people they represent, so we are organised by pupils from the 9 high schools in Falkirk Cluster. This means we can make sure we are working on issues that genuinely matter to us, and that schools and councils have no control over us. However, it is important that we work with schools and other organisations so our plans can be successfully put into place
