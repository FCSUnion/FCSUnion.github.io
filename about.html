  <p>The Falkirk Cluster Students Union was formed in May 2023, inspired by the success of the <a href="https://ehssu.com">Edinburgh High School Students Union</a>, with the aim of giving a voice to young people in Falkirk. <br>As High School students, it is often difficult to have our voices heard. However by joining together, <br> we can collectively raise issues and create a better and more positive educational experience for all.
  <br>
  <br>
  Membership is open to anyone who currently attends a Secondary School in Falkirk.
  <br>
  <br>             
  Advantages of joining include:
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Getting your voice heard and put pressure on those who can make changes</li>
  <li>Collectively raising the issues that matter to you</li>
  <li>Being part of a network of other students with common interests and goals</li>
  <li>Helping work towards a better education experience for all</li></p>
